title: What is a Pro Router?
meta: Let's explain basics of frontend routing in Pro - which uses a singleton service.

<p>
Let us look on an example URL:

{% highlight bash %}
http://www.example.com/section/post/1/comment/123
{% endhighlight %}

On any site we can play in JS console with a <b>location</b> object.
So we'll see an url contains of a <b>protocol</b>, <b>hostname</b> and a <b>pathname</b>.

Saying about pathname it's this part:
{% highlight bash %}
/section/post/1/comment/123
{% endhighlight %}

What we can say about this string it has sections separated by <b>/</b>.
It means we can split by it and receive an array:

{% highlight ruby %}
['section', 'post', '1', 'comment', '123']
{% endhighlight %}

Let's agree that first element <b>section</b> is a view name.
Then make from the other elements an array of pairs:

{% highlight ruby %}
[['post', '1'], ['comment', '123']]
{% endhighlight %}

Which can be easily translated to a hash:

{% highlight ruby %}
{ post: 1, comment: 123 }
{% endhighlight %}

You can treat this hash as an equivalent of Ruby on Rails params object
which you use in Rails controllers. But here you use it in frontend components.

Play it in console using those methods:

{% highlight ruby %}
Router.view
{% endhighlight %}

and

{% highlight ruby %}
Router.param('post')
{% endhighlight %}

and

{% highlight ruby %}
Router.write({ post: 2 })
{% endhighlight %}

or

{% highlight ruby %}
Router.write('post', 2)
{% endhighlight %}

Read the code <a href='https://github.com/madmaniak/pro/blob/master/framework/components/router/router.coffee'>here</a>.

You can use it with any single page application outside Pro. If you need help just drop me a line. Have fun!
